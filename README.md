## Features
- User-friendly interface to input fitness data.
- Backend API for processing input and predicting fitness levels.
- Trained a Neural Network model for fitness prediction.
- Secure and responsive design.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/VanillaJS)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP/Heroku

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
[git clone https://github.com/your-username/fitness-level-predictor.git](https://github.com/anonymous298/Fitness-Level-Predictor-Project.git)
cd fitness-level-predictor

# Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Enter your fitness parameters (e.g., age, weight, height, activity level).
3. Click "Predict" to get your fitness level.
